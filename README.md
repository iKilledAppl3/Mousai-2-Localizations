# Mousai 2 Language Translations (localizations)
 
I needed translators for Mousai 2

So I put it up here...

want to translate in your language?

It's simple just edit the .strings file for your language for example 

en.lproj is English (USA) so I Would edit the part after the CAPS

So in the AppleMusicM2.strings file I would edit 

DISABLE_BLUR = Disable Blur

(edit the part after the equals)...

#IMPORTANT 

 To find out which language is yours follow this:
 http://www.ibabbleon.com/iOS-Language-Codes-ISO-639.html

 for example:
 es.lproj (Spanish)
 es-MX.lproj is (Spanish [Mexico])
